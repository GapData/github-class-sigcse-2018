## Abstract

Git has a learning curve for students (and teachers). What is the benefit of learning version control, and integrating real-world tools in your course? In this series of talks, teachers will share why they choose to use Git and GitHub, and how it benefits their classroom practice.

Priming for collaboration: what are the mental models, instincts, and practices students need to succeed in internships and industry?

Tools students can grow with: how does Git give students the ability to transfer their knowledge from year to year and from role to role?

Assessing student work in-context: what benefits does GitHub offer in terms of authentic assessment, contextual feedback, and helping students iterate to improve?

This session is suitable for teachers thinking about using version control, or teachers who use GitHub and want a deeper understanding of features and benefits.
